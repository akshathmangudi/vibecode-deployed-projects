Prompt:
> Create a fully responsive, superfast, and lightweight web-based notepad application named “Ajay – Smart Notepad”. Use only frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React.js if supported). The entire project must be written in a single code block/file. The design must support modern deep animations, premium color transitions, smooth scrolling effects, and must work flawlessly on all devices including laptops, desktops, mobile phones (Android/iOS), macOS, and Windows. The final output must be deployable instantly on platforms like GitHub Pages, Blogger, or any other free hosting services without build tools or backends.  At the top of the application, include: - Dark/Light mode toggle switch (must switch theme instantly) - App name as heading: “Ajay – Smart Notepad” - Slogan: “Realizing Dreams Through the Touch of Technology” - Short description below heading: “A smart, fast, and accessible digital notepad for writing, organizing, and managing your thoughts with ease.” - Developer Credit: Ajay Thakur and S M Ripon - Community & Team Credit: Accessible Resource  Main Interface: - Home screen shows two buttons only:   • “Create a New Note”   • “Manage Your Notes”  When “Create a New Note” is clicked: - A new full-screen view opens with:   • Input for Note Title   • Textarea for Note Content   • Dropdown to select Note Category   • “Create New Category” button if the category does not exist   • “Save” button to store the note in browser localStorage   • “Go Back” button to return to home screen - While in this view, no other menu items or home content should be visible  When “Manage Your Notes” is clicked: - A new full-screen view opens with:   • A list of saved notes (titles only)   • Clicking a title opens another screen with:     – Full note content     – “Edit Note” button: opens an editable view with the note content in a textbox. User can modify and then click “Save” to update the note in localStorage. Once saved, the previous version is permanently replaced and not retained.     – “Copy” button: copies content to clipboard     – “Share” button: uses navigator.share if supported     – “Delete” button: removes the note after confirmation     – “Download as Text” button: allows the user to save the note as a .txt file on their device     – “Go Back” button: returns to notes list or home - While in this view, hide all other interface content  Technical Requirements: - Use only localStorage for saving notes and categories using structured JSON - Entire app must be coded in one HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript - Dark/Light theme must apply instantly using toggle and CSS variables - All UI pages (Home, Create Note, Manage Notes, Note Details, Edit Mode) must be handled within the single file using JavaScript logic - Design must include smooth transitions, modern UI, and be visually polished with text shadows, color effects, and scroll animations - Do not include Login or Sign Up form - No backend or database; everything must work client-side only - Must be 100% ad-free, work offline, and run independently in the browser - Must load instantly and work on all screen sizes with fast response - Notes can be exported as downloadable .txt files directly from the device - Edited notes fully replace the original content in localStorage without preserving the old version  Deliver the app as a complete static project written entirely in one single code block/file using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ready to be deployed directly via GitHub Pages, Blogger, or any other static hosting platform.

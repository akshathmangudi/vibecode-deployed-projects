Prompt:
> Create a simple, single-page web application where users can play Uno with strangers. The app should have a basic lobby where users can join a game, and a game board where they can play Uno. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include basic game logic for drawing cards, playing cards, and following Uno rules. Keep it simple and focus on the core functionality.

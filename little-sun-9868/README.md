Prompt:
> Create a fully functional and feature-packed notes app with a Material You UI. The app should allow users to create, edit, and delete notes. It should also support basic text formatting (bold, italics, underline). Include a search functionality to quickly find notes. Implement a color-coding system for notes to categorize them. The UI should adhere to Material You design principles, with dynamic theming based on the user's wallpaper. Include a settings page to customize the app's appearance and behavior.

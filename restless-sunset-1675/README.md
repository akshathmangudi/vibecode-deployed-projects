Prompt:
> Create a simple web app with a title 'AI Learning Companion'. The app should have two input fields: one for the user to select the competitive exam they are preparing for (e.g., JEE, NEET, CAT, UPSC) using a dropdown menu, and another for them to rate their current skill level on a scale of 1-5 (1 being beginner, 5 being expert). Include a 'Submit' button. Use basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The app should display a thank you message after submission.

Prompt:
> Create a simple, single-file web application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. The app should have input fields for height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms), a button to calculate BMI, and a display area to show the calculated BMI value and its corresponding weight status (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese).
